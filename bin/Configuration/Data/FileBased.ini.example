    ;;
    ;; This plugin loads the region information (such as terrain and objects) from an Aurora Backup file 
    ;; rather than from a normal database. This is much faster than a normal database and can be used to
    ;; automatically save backups of regions as well. This is the default option in Aurora
    ;;
    ;; In directory paths you can use ~ for home directory, %username% to put your user name in the path. On Windows, you can use %homedrive% in place of your drive letter(Like if you stored your backups already on an external hard drive letter, X for example vs. C main drive).
